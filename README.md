I kick start the project by sketching out how the landing oage will look like on a paper
After that , i created my file directory in the order: index.html, styles.css,javascript.js and a image folder for assests
I the code oyt the semantic html and add some css rules to it
I retouch the css by using my barnd color and added some javescript for responsiveness
